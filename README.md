## Lifting and Roasting Tracker
### A funny CLI application written in Python 

### Background story behind this app 
I am primarily a front end developer, and I wanted to expand my knowledge on the backend languages. My first programming language was Python, but when I attended coding bootcamp and eventually got a job in the industry I ended up working primarily in the front end. 

I was getting a little bit bored of Javascript and I wanted to expand my domain and knowledge. During the month of June around my birthday I made a commmitment to learn a backend language. While I know Ruby as well I wanted to refresh my Python knowledge. I started going through codesignal learn, but wasn't satisfied with the fact that I could only do 5 lessons at a time before my "lives" were out per day. 

After finding out about boot.dev and trying out the platform, and seeing multiple discount codes on Youtube through ads, I decided to commit to buying the course and going through several lessons every day. 

I completed the Python basics course as well as the Object Oriented course, and wanted to make something out of it. 

Also, I'm a competive powerlifter getting ready for nationals, I'm known to be extremely lazy and I complain often when it comes to training. Which results in me often being roasted by my coach. So I decided to create a CLI app showing that I can do stuff in Python while tracking my lifts and how many times I've gotten roasted.
